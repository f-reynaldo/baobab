# Baoram

Baoram is the Memory Usage Analyzer.

Baoram is a simple application which can scan system processes and give a graphical representation including each process memory usage or percentage in the tree. It builds a hierarchical tree of processes based on their parent-child relationships, aggregating memory usage up the tree.

## Features

- Hierarchical process tree view.
- Graphical representation of memory usage using rings or treemap charts.
- Aggregated memory usage (Resident Set Size) for process groups.
- "Kill Process" functionality directly from the UI.
- Overall system memory status.

## Hacking

The code is a fork of GNOME Baoram, repurposed for memory analysis.
